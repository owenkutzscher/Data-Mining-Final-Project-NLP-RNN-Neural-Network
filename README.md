# Predicting Amazon Reviews 

### Authors: Sebastian Vargas and Owen Kutzscher

This is a repository containing the source code for our final project for CSCI 4502: Data Mining. 

For this project we created various models to predict the number of stars in a review (score) based on the reviews text content. To accomplish this we originally planned on only implementing a BERT text classification model from TensorFlow. However after getting the BERT model to work the objective pivoted from "can we get a BERT model to work?" to "what other data mining methods can we use for text classification, and which works best?" So we brought in some more traditional data mining techniques. We added in various methods of feature selection: n-grams and TF-IDF, paired with several vectorization techniques. Then we tried out models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayesian Classifiers.
