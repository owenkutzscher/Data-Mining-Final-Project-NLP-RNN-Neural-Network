# Predicting Amazon Reviews 

Authors: Sebastian Vargas and Owen Kutzscher

This is a repository containing the source code for our final project for CSCI 4502: Data Mining. 

There are two main folders: "data", containing a link to our selected dataset from Kaggle which is titled "Amazon Product Reviews". "Code" contains all of our code for the project. We have a few different .ipynb files, broken up by how we manipulate the data.
